Welcome to this weapon maker tool thinggy. Untill I find a way to implement this within my game, I'll have no other choice but to do it this way.
What the hell is this tool you might ask?
For those who were wondering, while I was manuely writing every single dam weapon in the game from scratch, I thought to my self. Why should I waste hours of my precious time doing this crap when I could just automate this process with the help of AI I mean what?
I, totally didn't just say that? I mean, ahem. But siriosely though, courtesy goes out to my coding assistant claude for it's generous contributions. Without it I would of been in the dark about what to do with myself while writing this.
Anyways, this little app lets you add, edit, and view weapons, along with showing there respected stats for them. Just so I don't make myself look like an olympic athlete with my lazy ass, I'm still going to be making shields manuely, as even I don't particularly feel like asking my coding assistant for any more help then I give it credit for. Sorry not sorry.
Enjoy or whatever. I'm going to take a well Deserved coding bath to wash off all my functions and sintaks down the drain. Woopty doo!
